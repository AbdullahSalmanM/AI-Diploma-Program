## Recommendations | التوصيات

### ✅ No Action Required
All core topics for Course 04 are covered in notebooks. Topics mentioned in READMEs but not in notebooks are intentionally omitted to avoid duplication with future courses.

### Intentionally Omitted Topics (May be in Future Courses):
1. **Elastic Net** - Combination of Ridge/Lasso (core concepts covered)
2. **DBSCAN** - Advanced clustering algorithm (core clustering covered)
3. **Gradient Boosting (sklearn)** - Basic implementation (XGBoost/LightGBM covered)
4. **AdaBoost** - Early boosting algorithm (modern boosting covered)

### Rationale:
- Core algorithms and concepts are fully covered
- Advanced/variation topics may be covered in future courses
- Avoids duplication across courses
- Students learn all essential concepts in Course 04
