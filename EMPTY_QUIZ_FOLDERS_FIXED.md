# Empty Quiz Folders - Fixed ✅

## Issue Found

Empty `quizzes/` folders were found in Course 03 modules after quizzes were moved to the centralized `QUIZZES/` folder.

## Folders Removed

### Course 03 Modules
- ✅ `Course 03/modules/module_01/quizzes` (empty)
- ✅ `Course 03/modules/module_02/quizzes` (empty)
- ✅ `Course 03/modules/module_03/quizzes` (empty)
- ✅ `Course 03/modules/module_04/quizzes` (empty)
- ✅ `Course 03/modules/module_05/quizzes` (empty)

**Total:** 5 empty folders removed

## Why They Were Empty

When quizzes were standardized and moved to the main `QUIZZES/` folder (to match Courses 02, 04, 05, and 06), the quiz files were moved but the empty folders were left behind.

## Current Status

✅ All quizzes are now in: `Course 03/QUIZZES/`
- `Quiz_01_Linear_Algebra.md`
- `Quiz_02_Calculus.md`
- `Quiz_03_Optimization_Statistics.md`
- `Quiz_04_Dimensionality_Reduction.md`
- `Quiz_05_Probabilities_Inference.md`

✅ All empty quiz folders removed

✅ Course structure is now clean and consistent

## Verification

All courses checked:
- ✅ Course 01: Quiz folders have content (quizzes still in units)
- ✅ Course 02: Quizzes in QUIZZES/ folder
- ✅ Course 03: Empty folders removed, quizzes in QUIZZES/ folder
- ✅ Course 04: Quizzes in QUIZZES/ folder
