# Empty SELF_ASSESSMENT and public Folders - Fixed ✅

## Issue Found

Empty `SELF_ASSESSMENT/` and `public/` folders were found in some courses.

## Analysis Results

### SELF_ASSESSMENT Folders:
- ✅ **Course 01**: No SELF_ASSESSMENT folder (not needed)
- ✅ **Course 02**: Has content (3 files: 2 checkpoints + README)
- ⚠️ **Course 03**: Was empty → **FIXED** (added README.md)
- ⚠️ **Course 04**: Was empty → **FIXED** (added README.md)
- ✅ **Course 05**: No SELF_ASSESSMENT folder (not needed)
- ✅ **Course 06**: No SELF_ASSESSMENT folder (not needed)

### public Folders:
- ⚠️ **Course 03**: Was empty → **REMOVED** (not referenced or used)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created README.md Files
Added documentation to empty SELF_ASSESSMENT folders:
- `Course 03/SELF_ASSESSMENT/README.md` - Created
- `Course 04/SELF_ASSESSMENT/README.md` - Created

**Content includes:**
- Purpose of self-assessment
- How to use checkpoints
- Tips for students
- Placeholder for future checkpoints

### 2. Removed Unused Folder
- Removed `Course 03/public/` folder (empty, not referenced in README or anywhere)

## Current Status

### SELF_ASSESSMENT Folders:
- ✅ **Course 02**: 3 files (Checkpoint_After_Notebook_00.md, Checkpoint_After_Notebook_05.md, README.md)
- ✅ **Course 03**: 1 file (README.md - ready for future checkpoints)
- ✅ **Course 04**: 1 file (README.md - ready for future checkpoints)

### public Folders:
- ✅ None remaining (removed unused empty folder)

## Purpose of SELF_ASSESSMENT

Self-assessment checkpoints help students:
- ✅ Verify understanding after each module/unit
- ✅ Identify areas that need review
- ✅ Track learning progress
- ✅ Prepare for quizzes and projects
- ✅ Build confidence in knowledge

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to add actual checkpoints to Course 03 and Course 04:
1. Create checkpoint files similar to Course 02
2. Add checkpoints after each module/unit
3. Include knowledge checks, practice questions, and self-evaluation

**Example structure:**
- `Checkpoint_After_Module_01.md`
- `Checkpoint_After_Module_02.md`
- etc.
