    "- ✅ **If-then rules** - Understanding logical reasoning\n",

    "This adds REASONING to knowledge bases!\n",

    "- Comes BEFORE: Forward/Backward chaining (which use rules)\n",

    "\n",
    "### 📖 The Story\n",
    "**BEFORE**: We have facts but can't derive new knowledge from them.\n",
    "**AFTER**: We use rules to INFER new facts automatically (like \"Socrates is mortal\" from \"Socrates is human\" and \"Humans are mortal\")!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Concepts You'll Learn:\n",
    "1. **Rules**: IF conditions THEN conclusion (e.g., \"IF X is Human AND Humans are Mortal THEN X is Mortal\")\n",
    "2. **Forward Chaining**: Start with facts → apply rules → derive new facts (data-driven)\n",
    "3. **Variables in Rules**: Use \"X\" to match any entity (pattern matching)\n",
    "4. **Why Check Before Adding**: Prevents infinite loops (same rule adding same fact repeatedly)"

    "## Final Summary: Knowledge Representation | الملخص النهائي: تمثيل المعرفة\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned | ماذا تعلمنا:\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE this notebook**: \n",
    "- ❌ Scattered facts with no structure\n",
    "- ❌ No way to query or reason about knowledge\n",
    "- ❌ No visual representation of relationships\n",
    "- ❌ No way to infer new knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "**AFTER this notebook**:\n",
    "- ✅ **Structured Knowledge Base**: Facts stored systematically\n",
    "- ✅ **Knowledge Graphs**: Visual representation of relationships\n",
    "- ✅ **Rule-Based Systems**: Forward and backward chaining for reasoning\n",
    "- ✅ **Semantic Networks**: Inheritance of properties\n",
    "- ✅ **Inference**: Can derive new knowledge from existing facts!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Concepts Used:\n",
    "1. **Classes**: Model facts, rules, and knowledge structures\n",
    "2. **Dictionaries**: Fast lookups and associations\n",
    "3. **Graphs**: NetworkX for complex graph operations\n",
    "4. **Inheritance**: Property inheritance in semantic networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 How This Connects to Other Notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learned here builds on and leads to:**\n",
    "- **Notebook 1: Search Algorithms** - Knowledge graphs use the same graph concepts (nodes, edges) you learned in search algorithms. The difference: search algorithms find paths, knowledge graphs store relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebook 3: Learning under Uncertainty** - You learned reasoning with CERTAIN facts here. Notebook 3 extends this to reasoning with UNCERTAIN facts using probabilities. Both use reasoning, but with different certainty levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebook 5: AI Learning Models** - Knowledge representation provides the foundation for how ML models store and use information. Understanding structured knowledge helps you understand how models learn patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this order?**\n",
    "1. **After Search Algorithms**: You understand graphs (nodes, edges) - knowledge graphs use the same concepts!\n",
    "2. **Before Uncertainty**: Learn reasoning with certain facts first, then extend to uncertain facts\n",
    "3. **Foundation for AI**: All AI systems need to represent knowledge - this is the foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications:\n",
    "- 🏥 **Expert Systems**: Medical diagnosis systems that use knowledge bases to diagnose diseases based on symptoms\n",
    "- 🤖 **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding relationships between words and concepts in text\n",
    "- 🔍 **Search Engines**: Google's knowledge graph powers search results and answers\n",
    "- 📚 **Semantic Web**: Structured data on the internet that machines can understand\n",
    "- 💬 **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Siri, Alexa use knowledge representation to understand and answer questions\n",
    "- 🏢 **Business Intelligence**: Representing business rules and relationships for automated decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "1. **Structure enables reasoning**: Organized knowledge allows automated inference and querying\n",
    "2. **Graphs are powerful**: Knowledge graphs make complex relationships visual and understandable\n",
    "3. **Rules enable automation**: Rule-based systems can reason automatically from facts\n",
    "4. **Foundation for advanced AI**: Understanding knowledge representation is essential for NLP, expert systems, and semantic AI"
